      <h3>Relieve Menstrual Pain</h3>
      <p>May Periods are a nightmare for most women; however, asafoetida may come to your rescue by alleviating the menstrual pain and cramps in the lower abdomen and back. Being a natural blood thinner, it helps blood flow smoothly without hampering any part of your body.
